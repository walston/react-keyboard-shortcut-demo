# PROGRESSIVE WEB APP STARTER

**Fork to get started. Merge in changes when updated**

This is Hart's official Electron PWA Starter. It is based on Create-React-App for
ease and simplicity, but uses a translation layer to Electron to provide bindings
to some native features like the application menu bar and context menus (coming soon).

## Getting Started

- Fork this repository in Gitlab
- Clone locally: `git clone https://gitlab.hrt.io/frontend/my-pwa`
- Go into repository: `cd my-pwa`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start the app in dev: `npm start`

## Provided Scripts

- `npm start` will launch both `create-react-app` and `electron` in `development` mode
- `npm build` will compile the application for distribution
